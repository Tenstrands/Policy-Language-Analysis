The Board of Trustees believes that the conservation of water, energy and other natural resources as well as the
protection of the environment are essential to the health and well-being of the community. The Superintendent or
designee shall develop an integrated waste management program to reduce waste, conserve natural resources and
protect the environment.
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a waste reduction and resource recovery policy to reduce the District's
landfill footprint. This policy is designed to provide guidance to preserve resources and comply with state and local
laws related to waste management and resource recovery.
Goal
The District's goal is to develop a resource recovery program that engages staff, students, parents and its
surrounding communities to be stewards of the environment and reduce the amount of recyclables and
compostables sent to landfill.
Background: California Mandatory Recycling Law-AB 341 and AB 1826
The State of California established a 75% recycling goal, including source reduction, recycling and composting, by
2020. According to California's Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) waste
characterization report, about half of the school's waste stream is organics/compostable, followed by paper.
? Assembly Bill 341 - Effective July 1, 2012, requires businesses and public entities, including schools and school
districts that generate four cubic yards of waste or more to recycle.
? Assembly Bill 1826 - Effective April 1, 2016, requires businesses and public entities, including schools and school
districts that generate a specific amount of organic waste to divert its materials from the landfill.
Responsibilities of All District Facilities and Schools
Comply with all state and local laws relating to waste management and to make resource conservation an integral
part of the physical operations and curriculum of the school district. Each district facility and school shall:
1. Evaluate their waste stream to identify waste reduction opportunities:
a. Replace disposables with reusable whenever possible.
b. Reuse or donate materials whenever possible.
c. Solicit the use of recycled and other environmentally preferable products in its procurement process as
appropriate.
d. Ensure proper handling and disposal of hazardous waste.
i. Hazardous waste includes but not limited to paints, solvents, pesticides, fluorescent light bulbs,
lubricants, vehicle batteries, household batteries, etc.
2. Encourage and promote the 4R's: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Rot
a. Prevent recyclables and compostables from going to the landfill.
i. Collect recyclables from every district facility, office, classroom, lunchroom and kitchen.
Recyclables include cardboard, nonfood-soiled paper such as office paper, one-time use glass, such
as soda bottles and metal (aluminum and steel) cans and rigid plastics.
ii. Collect compostables from every district facility, kitchen, restroom and eating area.Compostables include food scraps, food-soiled paper, paper towels, shredded paper, untreated
wood and plant debris.
b. Ensure each site subscribes to recycling and green waste services
c. Educate students, teachers, administrators and classified staff on ""what goes where"".
3. Engage staff, parents and students to serve as a model for the District and unity to influence waste prevention,
recycling and procurement efforts.
a. Promote waste reduction and resource recovery efforts and accomplishments through social media,
newsletters and assemblies.
b. Establish partnerships with local agencies such as Stopwaste and Alameda County Office of Education.
c. Encourage extracurricular activities, such as student lead waste audits, campus beautification and clean-
up projects and reusable goods collection drives for local charities.
d. The Superintendent/designee shall establish and maintain a Recycling Committee that will include
teachers, administrators, classified staff and local partners who will meet annually to review the District's
waste reduction and resource recovery efforts, suggest recommendations that promote resource
conservation. The Committee may present as annual report to the Board.
4. Work with vendors and contractors to use packaging and delivery materials that generate less waste.
5. Work with city, county or other government agencies to locate markets for the district's reusable and
recyclable materials.",Emery_Unified_Alameda_AR3511.1.pdf,Emery_Unified_Alameda_AR3511.1.pdf

Note: The following administrative regulation may be revised to reflect district practice.
For all applicable areas of district operations, the Superintendent or designee shall design an integrated waste
management program that minimizes the generation of waste, encourages the recovery and diversion of reusable
materials from the waste stream, improves efficiency in the utilization of natural and material resources, and protects
the environment. The program shall implement measures and/or practices to:

Note: Pursuant to Public Resources Code 42649.2, any business or public entity, including a school or other
district facility, which generates four or more cubic yards of commercial solid waste per week (approximately
the size of a 72-inch length, 51-inch width, and 56-inch rear height dumpster) is required to arrange for
recycling services in accordance with law, to the extent that such services are available from a local provider.
Commercial solid waste, as defined in Public Resources Code 42649.1, means any type of solid waste
generated by stores, offices, or other commercial or public entity source.
Any school site or district facility which generates four or more cubic yards of solid waste per week shall take at least
one of the following actions: (Public Resources Code 42649.1, 42649.2)
1. Source separate recyclable materials from solid waste and subscribe to a basic level of recycling service that
includes collection, self-hauling, or other arrangements for the pickup of the recyclable materials
2. Subscribe to a recycling service which may include mixed waste processing that yields diversion results
comparable to source separation
Note: In September 2020, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)
determined, pursuant to Public Resources Code 42649.81, that the statewide disposal of organic waste has
not been reduced to 50 percent of the 2014 level of disposal. Thus, any school facility that generates two or
more cubic yards per week of solid waste is required to meet requirements pertaining to the recycling of
organic waste as described below. CalRecyle's Frequently Asked Questions clarify that, for this purpose, the
threshold applies to solid waste, recyclables, and organics.
CalRecycle also extended the exemption in Public Resources Code 42649.81 and 42649.83 for rural jurisdictions
that adopt a resolution as specified. Districts in rural jurisdiction that have adopted such a resolution may delete the
following paragraph.
Any school site or district facility which generates two or more cubic yards per week of solid waste, recyclables, and
organics shall arrange for recycling services specifically for organic waste, including food waste, green waste,
landscape and pruning waste, nonhazardous wood waste, and food-soiled paper waste that is mixed in with food
waste. Such facilities shall take at least one of the following actions: (Public Resources Code 42649.8, 42649.81-
42649.82, 42649.84)
1. Source separate organic waste from other waste and subscribe to a basic level of organic waste recycling
service that includes collection and recycling of organic waste2. Recycle organic waste onsite or self-haul organic waste for recycling
3. Subscribe to an organic waste recycling service that may include mixed waste processing that specifically
recycles organic waste
4. Make other arrangements to sell or donate recyclable organic waste materials
Note: Public Resources Code 42649.2 and 42649.81 require a school or other district facility that generates at
least four cubic yards of solid waste or two cubic yards of organic waste per week to provide recycling bins or
containers to collect material purchased on the premises. According to CalRecycle's school poster, Recycling
and Organics Recycling Guide for Schools, bins or containers must be placed where material is purchased on
the premises for immediate consumption, such as areas where food is consumed.
Any school site or district facility that meets the above thresholds for solid or organic waste shall place a recycling
bin or container for solid or organic waste, as applicable, in areas where food or other materials are purchased at the
facility for immediate consumption. The recycling bin or container shall be: (Public Resources Code 42649.2,
42649.81)
1. Adjacent to each bin or container for nonrecyclable trash, except in restrooms
2. Visible and easily accessible
Note: Public Resources Code 42649.2 and 42649.81 require that each recycling bin or container be clearly
marked with educational signage indicating what is appropriate to place in the bin or container. CalRecycle
provides customizable signage for this purpose on its web site, or districts may contact their local government
or waste hauler for signage.
3. Clearly marked with educational signage indicating appropriate items to be placed in the recycling bin or
container in accordance with state law and the local jurisdiction's waste ordinances and practices

1. A brief description of the type of fee in the account or fund
2. The amount of the fee
3. The beginning and ending balance of the account or fund
4. The amount of the fees collected and the interest earned
5. An identification of each public improvement on which fees were expended and the amount of the
expenditures on each improvement, including the total percentage of the cost of the public improvement that
was funded with fees
6. An identification of an approximate date by which the construction of the public improvement will commence
if the district determines that sufficient funds have been collected to complete financing on an incomplete
public improvement
7. A description of each interfund transfer or loan made from the account or fund, including the public
improvement on which the transferred or loaned fees will be expended, and, in the case of an interfund loan,
the date on which the loan will be repaid, and the rate of interest that the account or fund will receive on the
loan
8. The amount of refunds made pursuant to Government Code 66001(e) and any allocations made pursuant to
Government Code 66001(f)
When sufficient funds have been collected to complete the financing of public improvements but such
improvements remain incomplete, the district shall, within 180 days of the date that a determination of sufficient
funding was made, either identify an approximate date by which construction will begin or refund the unexpended
revenues in accordance with Government Code 66001. (Government Code 66001)

Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Practices And Integrated Waste Management
Business and Non-instructional Operations
The Governing Board recognizes the need to manage resources efficiently, responsibly
and cost effectively. Source and pollution reduction, reusing, and recycling are necessary
to minimize the impact on the environment and can also result in cost savings.
The purpose of this Administrative Regulation to support the purchase of
environmentally preferable products in order to minimize environmental impacts.
CCUSD supports purchasing environmentally preferable products whenever they perform
satisfactorily and are available at a reasonably competitive price.
The District staff should serve as positive role models to students and the community
concerning conservation issues.
The Superintendent or designee will seek to implement strategies that are both
resourceful and responsible. Examples of such strategies may include, but are not limited
to:
1. Reduce District waste by prevention practices such as double sided copying,
email, electronic ordering and electronic filing.
2. Recycle District used materials such as paper, cardboard, aluminum, glass and
metal containers and composting of food waste and landscape materials.
3. Reuse and recycle construction and demolition materials to the greatest extent
possible.
4. Purchase products that/are:
a. Contain the highest amount of post-consumer material practicable;
b. Non-hazardous to the extent feasible, and do not emit harmful emissions
or volatile organic compounds to the extent feasible; and are readily bio-
degradable and non-persistent in the environment after use, where
practicable;
c. Energy Star certified, if US EPA Energy Star certification is available, and
Water Sense certified, if a US EPA Water Sense certification is available.
5. Regularly assess each department’s effectiveness in applying this policy.
6. Provide training to new and existing employees about this policy as needed.
The Superintendent will seek to adopt appropriate school and departmental procedures
that communicate the goals of this Environmentally Preferable Purchasing and Practices
(EPPP) Policy.

Resource Management Program
In the development of the district's resource management program, the Superintendent or designee shall analyze and
review the lighting; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems; water heaters; electrical equipment and
appliances; water use and irrigation; and sustainable solid waste and recycling systems.
The following district operations shall be incorporated into the district's resource management program:
1. Educational programs
2. Classroom and building management and maintenance
3. Operational equipment maintenance
4. Landscaping
5. Transportation services
6. New construction
7. Use of facilities by outside groups
8. Fleet Maintenance
9. School Food Practices
10. Procurement Practices
To ensure the overall success of the energy resource management program, the following are specific areas of
emphasis:
1. Every student and employee will be expected to contribute to energy efficiency and environmental
sustainability in our district.
2. All unnecessary heating, ventilation & air conditioning systems (HVAC), lighting, and equipment in unoccupied
areas will be turned off. All lights will be turned off when students, staff or facility users leave school. During
breaks in excess of one week, teachers and staff shall be required to unplug equipment.
3. Energy and environmental resource management on his/her campus will be made a part of the principal's and
plant manager's annual evaluation.
4. The plant manager or designee at each school will be responsible for a complete and total shutdown of the
facility when closed each evening. Safety lighting shall remain on, along with HVAC where appropriate to
protect equipment. Such shut downs shall not occur if lack of air circulation will create an unhealthful room
environment as determined by County Health, CalOSHA, or other health official.
Strategies to improve the environmental impact of district operations may include, but not be limited to:
1. Reducing energy and water consumption and exploring renewable and clean energy technologies.
2. Coordinating with Director of Facilities, Maintenance & Operations to establish recycling programs in district
facilities, inclusive of green waste and composting.
3. Encouraging organized school-site parent/student groups to prioritize stewardship of environmental resources
and provide leadership at their respective site, in cooperation with site principal and plant manager.
4. Reducing the consumption of disposable materials, by reusing materials and by using electronic rather than
paper communications when feasible.5. Purchasing and using environmentally preferable products and services whenever practical, including, but not
limited to, products that:
a. Minimize environmental impacts, toxins, pollutants, odors, and hazards
b. Contain postconsumer recycled content
c. Are durable, long-lasting and re-usable
d. Conserve energy and water
e. Produce a low amount of waste
6. Using least toxic, independently certified green cleaning products when feasible, as well as high-efficiency
cleaning equipment that reduces the need to use potentially hazardous chemicals.
7. Providing professional development to maintenance staff in the topics of: the proper use, storage, and disposal
of cleaning supplies, and sustainable resource management programs (including, but not limited to, reducing,
reusing, recycling and composting (if applicable)).
8. Focusing on green building standards, sustainability, and student health in facilities construction and
modernization projects, including decisions about site selection, building design, and landscaping and grounds.
9. Reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, the discharge of pollutants into the water system in order to
minimize the threat to water quality from storm water runoff.
10. Reducing vehicle traffic by encouraging students to walk or bicycle to school or use carpooling, district or
public transportation.
11. Providing instruction to students on the importance of the environment and involving students in the
implementation and evaluation of green school activities and projects as appropriate.
12. Providing resources to parents and the community through e-newsletters and/or the district website on ideas
for conservation and how to encourage stewardship of the environment.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide staff and students with training and guidance on best practices to
achieve the district's goals. The Superintendent or designee may solicit
input from staff, students, and parents/guardians about the district's program. The Superintendent may invite district
staff, parents/guardians, students and community members to meet annually to review sustainability audit reports,
energy & environmental resource management policies and practices and prepare a report for the Board of
Education.",Las_Virgenes_Unified_Los_Angeles_AR3511.1.pdf,Las_Virgenes_Unified_Los_Angeles_AR3511.1.pdf

INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT
For all applicable areas of district operations, the Superintendent or designee may design an integrated waste
management program that minimizes the generation of waste, encourages the recovery and diversion of reusable
materials from the waste stream, improves efficiency in the utilization of natural and material resources, and protects
the environment. The program may implement measures and/or practices to:
1. Reduce the consumption of disposable materials, increase the composting of organic materials, and fully utilize
all materials prior to disposal
2. Recycle materials such as paper, glass, plastic, and aluminum
3. Prefer recycled, biodegradable, and other environmentally preferable products when procuring materials for
use in district schools and buildings or contracting for the construction or modernization of any district building
4. Work with city, county, or other government agencies to locate markets for the district's reusable and
recyclable materials
5. Minimize the use of nonbiodegradable materials and work with vendors and contractors to use packaging and
delivery materials that generate less waste
Recycling
Any school site or district facility which generates four or more cubic yards of solid waste per week may take at least
one of the following actions: (Public Resources Code 42649.1, 42649.2)
1. Source separate recyclable materials from solid waste and subscribe to a basic level of recycling service that
includes collection, self-hauling, or other arrangements for the pickup of the recyclable materials
2. Subscribe to a recycling service which may include mixed waste processing that yields diversion results
comparable to source separation
Any school site or district facility which generates two or more cubic yards per week of solid waste, recyclables, and
organics may arrange for recycling services specifically for organic waste, including food waste, green waste,
landscape and pruning waste, nonhazardous wood waste, and food-soiled paper waste that is mixed in with food
waste. Such facilities may take at least one of the following actions: (Public Resources Code 42649.8, 42649.81-
42649.82, 42649.84)
1. Source separate organic waste from other waste and subscribe to a basic level of organic waste recycling
service that includes collection and recycling of organic waste
2. Recycle organic waste onsite or self-haul organic waste for recycling
3. Subscribe to an organic waste recycling service that may include mixed waste processing that specifically
recycles organic waste
4. Make other arrangements to sell or donate recyclable organic waste materials
Any school site or district facility that meets the above thresholds for solid or organic waste may place a recycling bin
or container for solid or organic waste, as applicable, in areas where food or other materials are purchased at the
facility for immediate consumption. The recycling bin or container shall be: (Public Resources Code 42649.2,
42649.81)
1. Adjacent to each bin or container for nonrecyclable trash, except in restrooms

The Board establishes the following goals for waste reduction:
1. Lead community in resource conservation and recycling;
2. Make our practice consistent with our teaching;
3. Save money in a time of rising trash disposal costs;
4. Include all facilities, employees, and students in the program.
To ensure efficient utilization of natural and material resources, the Superintendent or designee shall work towards
instituting the following measures and/or practices:
1. Reduce waste generation by reducing the consumption of disposable materials, composting of organic materials
and fully utilizing all materials prior to disposal.
Each facility will consider additional waste reduction steps which are appropriate to their circumstances. This will
include inspection of the facility's waste output to determine other possibilities for reductions. Additional steps
which should be considered include:
a. On-site and off-site composting of food waste and other organics;
b. Substitution of reusable items for disposable items;
c. Elimination of unwanted junk mail; removal from unwanted mailing lists;
d. Two sided copying and printing;
e. Reuse of scrap paper.
2. Recycle materials such as paper, glass, plastic and aluminum, and minimize the use of non-compostable products.
The following materials will be collected separately from trash when financially feasible. Recycling pickup can be
arranged with the garbage hauler, or separate arrangements for recycling can be made at the discretion of the
facility. Periodic updates will be needed for changes in materials which will be accepted:
a. Office paper
b. Corrugated cardboard;
c. Newspaper, magazines and shredded paper;
d. Phonebooks;
e. Aluminum and tin cans;
f. Glass containers;
g. Plastic bottles;
h. Green waste and organics
The objective of each facility in implementing these steps will be to reduce the level of trash service. The Board shall
receive a periodic at least annual report on any reduction which has been achieved as to the size and frequency of
trash pickup.
The following procedures shall be implemented to support the waste reduction and recycling objectives:
District-wide
* Classrooms, Office Areas and Staff Rooms shall maintain separate, clearly marked receptacles for recyclables andtrash, such as:
o ""TRASH ONLY""
o ""PAPER""
o ""BOTTLES AND CANS ONLY""
* Encourage the establishment of ""Green Teams"" at each school site, consisting of an administrator, food services
manager, custodial supervisor, teachers(s) and students to promote recycling and assist with implementation of
recycling policies.
* Provide information as needed to employees and students about the District's recycling policies.
* Encourage the recognition of employees and students for programs successfully implemented and the resulting
environmental benefits and cost-savings for the District.
* Provide students/parents with written recycling guidelines at least once per school year, such as in student
orientation packets.
School-wide
* Place ""Bottles and Cans only"" receptacles at strategic locations on campus.
* Encourage student participation in recycling activities.
* Distribute recycling guidelines at least once per school year, such as in student orientation packets.
* Provide ""Bottles and Cans only"" receptacles at school events
Food Service / Cafeterias
* Separate food items from trash when a food waste recycling program is in place
* Empty and recycle milk cartons
* Implement composting strategies when possible
* Cafeteria staff shall supervise proper recycling of empty food containers, cardboard and other
recyclables/compostables to minimize contamination
* Recycle corrugated cardboard and film plastic (i.e.: shrink wrap)
Maintenance/Operations/Grounds
* Continue efforts to recycle green waste.
* Head of Plant, or person designated by Director of Maintenance/Operations/Grounds, at each site shall be
responsible to regularly monitor waste removal to determine if the appropriate waste separation is being
implemented and the appropriate receptacles are available for waste and recycling.
3. Prefer recycled and other environmentally preferable products when procuring materials for use in district schools
and buildings or contracting for the construction or modernization of any district building.
(cf. 3300 - Expenditures and Purchases)
(cf. 3311 - Bids)
(cf. 3312 - Contracts)

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT
Definition
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) means a strategy that focuses on long-term prevention or
suppression of pest problems through a combination of techniques such as monitoring for
pest presence and establishing treatment threshold levels, using nonchemical practices to
make the habitat less conducive to pest development, improving sanitation, and employing
mechanical and physical controls. Pesticides that pose the least possible hazard and are
effective in a manner that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are used
only after careful monitoring indicates they are needed according to pre-established
guidelines and treatment thresholds. (Food and Agricultural Code 13181)
Procedures
The Superintendent/Principal or designee shall designate a staff person to develop,
implement, and coordinate an IPM program that incorporates effective, least toxic pest
management practices. The district's program shall include the following elements:
1. Carefully monitoring and identifying the pest population levels and identifying
practices that could affect pest populations. Strategies for managing the pest shall be
influenced by the pest species and whether that species poses a threat to people,
property, or the environment.
2. Setting action threshold levels to determine when pest populations or vegetation at a
specific location might cause unacceptable health or economic hazard that would
indicate corrective action should be taken.
3. Modifying or eliminating pest habitats to deter pest populations and minimize pest
infestations.
4. Considering a full range of possible alternative treatments. Such alternative
treatments may include taking no action or controlling the pest by physical,
horticultural, or biological methods. Cost or staffing considerations alone will not be
adequate justification for use of chemical control agents.
5. Selecting nonchemical pest management methods over chemical methods whenever
such methods are effective in providing the desired control or, when it is determined
that chemical methods must be used, giving preference to those chemicals that pose
the least hazard to people and the environment.
6. Ensuring that persons applying pesticides follow label precautions and are trained in
the principles and practices of IPM.
(cf. 4231 - Staff Development)AR 3514.2(b)
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (continued)
7. Limiting pesticide purchases to amounts needed for the year. Pesticides shall be
stored at a secure location that is not accessible to students and unauthorized staff.
They shall be stored and disposed of in accordance with state regulations and label
directions registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well
as any disposal requirements indicated on the product label.
(cf. 3514.1 - Hazardous Substances)
Prohibited Pesticides
The IPM Coordinator shall not use a pesticide on a school site if that pesticide has been
granted a conditional or interim registration or an experimental use permit by the California
Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) or if the pesticide is subject to an experimental
registration issued by the EPA and either of the following conditions exists: (Education
Code 17610.1)
1. The pesticide contains a new active ingredient.
2. The pesticide is for new use.
In addition, the IPM Coordinator shall not use a pesticide on the school site if DPR cancels or
suspends registration or requires that the pesticide be phased out from use. (Education Code
17610.1)
Notifications
The IPM Coordinator shall annually notify staff and parents/guardians of students enrolled at
the school, in writing, regarding pesticide products expected to be applied at the school
facility in the upcoming year. The notification shall include at least the following:
(Education Code 17612)
1. The Internet address (http://www.schoolipm.info) used to access information on
pesticides and pesticide use reduction developed by the DPR pursuant to Food and
Agricultural Code 13184.
2. The name of each pesticide product expected to be applied in the upcoming year and
the active ingredient(s) in it.
3. An opportunity for interested persons to register to receive notification of individual
pesticide application at the school. The IPM Coordinator shall notify such registered
persons of individual pesticide applications at least 72 hours prior to the application.
The notice shall include the product name, the active ingredient(s) in the product, and
the intended date of application.AR 3514.2(c)

(cf. 5145.6 - Parental Notifications)
If a pesticide product not included in the annual notification is subsequently intended for use
at the school site, the IPM Coordinator shall provide written notification of its intended use to
staff and parents/guardians of students enrolled at the school, at least 72 hours prior to the
application. (Education Code 17612)
Whenever the IPM Coordinator deems that the immediate use of a pesticide is necessary to
protect the health and safety of students, staff, or other persons at the school site, he/she shall
make every effort to provide the required notifications prior to the application of the
pesticide. (Education Code 17612)
(cf. 3514 - Environmental Safety)
Posting of Warning Signs
The IPM Coordinator shall post a warning sign at each area of the school site where
pesticides will be applied that shall be visible to all persons entering the treated area. The
sign shall be posted at least 24 hours prior to the application and until 72 hours after the
application. The warning sign shall display the following information: (Education Code
17612)
1. The term ""Warning/Pesticide Treated Area""
2. The product name, manufacturer's name, and the EPA's product registration number
3. Intended areas and dates of application
4. Reason for the pesticide application
When advance posting is not possible due to an emergency condition requiring immediate
use of a pesticide, the warning sign shall be posted immediately upon application and shall
remain posted until 72 hours after the application. (Education Code 17609, 17612)AR 3514.2(d)

Integrated Waste Management
AR 3511.1
Business and Noninstructional Operations
For all applicable areas of district operations, the Superintendent or designee shall design an
integrated waste management program that minimizes the generation of waste, encourages the
recovery and diversion of reusable materials from the waste stream, improves efficiency in the
utilization of natural and material resources, and protects the environment. The program shall
implement measures and/or practices to:
1. Reduce the consumption of disposable materials, increase the composting of organic
materials, and fully utilize all materials prior to disposal
2. Recycle materials such as paper, glass, plastic, and aluminum
3. Prefer recycled, biodegradable, and other environmentally preferable products when procuring
materials for use in district schools and buildings or contracting for the construction or
modernization of any district building
4. Work with city, county, or other government agencies to locate markets for the district's
reusable and recyclable materials
5. Minimize the use of non-biodegradable materials and work with vendors and contractors
to use packaging and delivery materials that generate less waste
Recycling
Any school site or district facility which generates four or more cubic yards of solid waste per
week shall take at least one of the following actions:
1. Source separate recyclable materials from solid waste and subscribe to a basic level of
recycling service that includes collection, self-hauling, or other arrangements for the
pickup of the recyclable materials
2. Subscribe to a recycling service which may include mixed waste processing that yields
diversion results comparable to source separation
Any school site or district facility which generates two or more cubic yards per week of solid
waste, recyclables, and organics shall arrange for recycling services specifically for organic
waste, including food waste, green waste, landscape and pruning waste, nonhazardous wood
waste, and food-soiled paper waste that is mixed in with food waste. Such facilities shall take at
least one of the following actions:
1. Source separate organic waste from other waste and subscribe to a basic level of organic
waste recycling service that includes collection and recycling of organic waste
2. Recycle organic waste onsite or self-haul organic waste for recycling
Page 1 of 33. Subscribe to an organic waste recycling service that may include mixed waste processing
that specifically recycles organic waste
4. Make other arrangements to sell or donate recyclable organic waste materials
Any school site or district facility that meets the above thresholds for solid or organic waste shall
place a recycling bin or container for solid or organic waste, as applicable, in areas where food or
other materials are purchased at the facility for immediate consumption. The recycling bin or
container shall be:
1. Adjacent to each bin or container for non-recyclable trash, except in restrooms
2. Visible and easily accessible
3. Clearly marked with educational signage indicating appropriate items to be placed in the
recycling bin or container in accordance with state law and the local jurisdiction's waste

Note: Pursuant to Public Resources Code 42649.2, any business or public entity, including a school or other
district facility, which generates four or more cubic yards of commercial solid waste per week (approximately
the size of a 72-inch length, 51-inch width, and 56-inch rear height dumpster) is required to arrange for
recycling services in accordance with law, to the extent that such services are available from a local provider.
Commercial solid waste, as defined in Public Resources Code 42649.1, means any type of solid waste generated
by stores, offices, or other commercial or public entity source.
Any school site or district facility which generates four or more cubic yards of solid waste per week shall take at least
one of the following actions: (Public Resources Code 42649.1, 42649.2)

Note: In September 2020, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)
determined, pursuant to Public Resources Code 42649.81, that the statewide disposal of organic waste has not
been reduced to 50 percent of the 2014 level of disposal. Thus, any school facility that generates two or more
cubic yards per week of solid waste is required to meet requirements pertaining to the recycling of organic
waste as described below. CalRecyle's Frequently Asked Questions clarify that, for this purpose, the thresholdapplies to solid waste, recyclables, and organics.
CalRecycle also extended the exemption in Public Resources Code 42649.81 and 42649.83 for rural
jurisdictions that adopt a resolution as specified. Districts in rural jurisdiction that have adopted such a
resolution may delete the following paragraph.
Any school site or district facility which generates two or more cubic yards per week of solid waste, recyclables, and
organics shall arrange for recycling services specifically for organic waste, including food waste, green waste,
landscape and pruning waste, nonhazardous wood waste, and food-soiled paper waste that is mixed in with food
waste. Such facilities shall take at least one of the following actions: (Public Resources Code 42649.8, 42649.81-

2. Recycle organic waste onsite or self-haul organic waste for recycling
3. Subscribe to an organic waste recycling service that may include mixed waste processing that specifically
recycles organic waste
4. Make other arrangements to sell or donate recyclable organic waste materials
Note: Public Resources Code 42649.2 and 42649.81 require a school or other district facility that generates at
least four cubic yards of solid waste or two cubic yards of organic waste per week to provide recycling bins or
containers to collect material purchased on the premises. According to CalRecycle's school poster, Recycling
and Organics Recycling Guide for Schools, bins or containers must be placed where material is purchased on the
premises for immediate consumption, such as areas where food is consumed.
Any school site or district facility that meets the above thresholds for solid or organic waste shall place a recycling
bin or container for solid or organic waste, as applicable, in areas where food or other materials are purchased at the
facility for immediate consumption. The recycling bin or container shall be: (Public Resources Code 42649.2,
42649.81)
1. Adjacent to each bin or container for nonrecyclable trash, except in restrooms
2. Visible and easily accessible
Note: Public Resources Code 42649.2 and 42649.81 require that each recycling bin or container be clearly
marked with educational signage indicating what is appropriate to place in the bin or container. CalRecycle
provides customizable signage for this purpose on its web site, or districts may contact their local government
or waste hauler for signage.
3. Clearly marked with educational signage indicating appropriate items to be placed in the recycling bin or

Integrated Waste Management
For all applicable areas of district operations, the Superintendent or designee shall design an integrated waste
management program that minimizes the generation of waste, encourages the recovery and diversion of reusable
materials from the waste stream, improves efficiency in the utilization of natural and material resources, and protects
the environment. The program shall implement measures and/or practices to:
1. Reduce the consumption of disposable materials, increase the composting of organic materials, and fully utilize
all materials prior to disposal
2. Recycle materials such as paper, glass, plastic, and aluminum
3. Prefer recycled, biodegradable, and other environmentally preferable products when procuring materials for
use in district schools and buildings or contracting for the construction or modernization of any district building
4. Work with city, county, or other government agencies to locate markets for the district's reusable and
recyclable materials

CELLULAR PHONE REIMBURSEMENT
When a district employee's position requires frequent use of a cell phone, the Superintendent
or designee shall provide either a cell phone for the employee's use or an allowance to the
employee for the business use of his/her personally owned cell phone, whichever is the most
cost-effective. In determining whether an employee's position requires frequent use of a cell
phone, the factors to be considered shall include, but not be limited to, whether the job
responsibilities require:
1. An ability to communicate frequently but access to a district landline is not readily
available
2. An ability to communicate immediately to ensure the safety of district staff and
students or the security of district property
3. A level of accessibility which is impossible because of the employee's frequent job-
related absence from the worksite
(cf. 3542 - School Bus Drivers)
(cf. 4156.3/4256.3/4356.3 - Employee Property Reimbursement)
When an employee is paid an allowance for the use of his/her personally owned cell phone
for district business, the Superintendent or designee shall, from time to time, verify that the
employee's cell phone contract is active.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a system for reviewing employees' use of
district-owned cell phones and the reimbursement of costs for employees' business-related
use of their personal cell phones. Employees shall be responsible for fees and charges
associated with any misuse or overuse not attributable to district business.
If the Superintendent or designee determines that an employee no longer needs a cell phone
or other mobile communications device to perform his/her job responsibilities, any fees or
charges associated with cancellation of the service contract shall be the responsibility of the
district.
Any employee who is not provided an allowance or a district-owned cell phone may be
reimbursed for the actual expenses of business-related calls made on his/her personally
owned cell phone, in accordance with the district's expense reimbursement procedures.

possible.
(cf. 5141.23 - Asthma Management)
7. Painting of school facilities and maintenance or repair activities that require the use of
potentially harmful substances shall be limited to those times when school is not in
session. Following any such activity, the facility shall be properly ventilated with
adequate time allowed prior to reopening for use by any person.
8. Paints, adhesives, and solvents shall be used and stored in well-ventilated areas.
These items shall be purchased in small quantities to avoid storage exposure.
(cf. 3514.1 - Hazardous Substances)
9. To the extent possible, printing and duplicating equipment that may generate indoor
air pollutants, such as methyl alcohol or ammonia, shall be placed in locations that are
well ventilated and not frequented by students and staff.
10. The district's tobacco-free schools policy shall be consistently enforced in order to
reduce the health risks caused by second-hand smoke.
(cf. 3513.3 - Tobacco-Free Schools)
11. Staff and students may be asked to refrain from bringing common irritants such as
furred or feathered animals, stuffed toys that may collect dust mites, scented candles,
incense, or air fresheners and from using perfume or cologne, scented lotion or hair
spray, nail polish or nail polish remover, or other personal care products that are not
fragrance-free in classrooms, school buses, or other enclosed areas or buildings.
(cf. 6163.2 - Animals at School)Outdoor Air Quality
The Superintendent or designee may coordinate with the local air resources control board and
monitor local health advisories and outdoor air quality alerts to obtain forecasts of ozone
levels, particle pollution, ultraviolet radiation levels, and/or temperature and humidity.
Whenever a forecast indicates a significant health risk, the Superintendent or designee shall
communicate with each principal so that outdoor activities, especially those requiring
prolonged or heavy exertion, may be avoided, limited in duration, or modified as necessary
for all persons or for persons who may be particularly susceptible to the health risk involved.

(cf. 6145.2 - Athletic Competition)
Reduction of Vehicle Emissions
In order to reduce public exposure to toxic air contaminants, school bus drivers and other
drivers of commercial motor vehicles shall limit unnecessary idling of vehicles at or near
schools in accordance with 13 CCR 2480. The Superintendent or designee may also request
parents/guardians to turn off their vehicles when they are idling on school grounds and
encourage students to walk and/or bicycle to school.

vehicle weight rating over 14,000 pounds shall be equipped with a particulate filter designed
to reduce particulate matter emissions, oxides of nitrogen emissions, and other pollutants.
(13 CCR 2025)
Drinking Water Safety
The quality and safety of the district's drinking water sources shall be regularly assessed, and
drinking fountains shall be regularly cleaned and maintained, to ensure that drinking water
consumed at school does not contain dirt, mold, lead, or other impurities or contaminants that
may cause serious health concerns.
Whenever any contaminants in the drinking water are determined to be a concern, the
Superintendent or designee shall take reasonable steps to identify the source and mitigate any
potential problem to ensure the availability of safe drinking water. As needed, the
Superintendent or designee shall provide alternative sources of drinking water, such as
bottled water or on-site water filtration, to ensure that students have access to fresh drinking
water at mealtimes and at other times throughout the day.
(cf. 3550 - Food Service/Child Nutrition Program)Whenever testing of drinking water finds concentrations of lead that exceed federal and state
standards, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians and take immediate
steps to shut down and make inoperable any fountains or faucets where excess lead levels
may exist.
Prevention of Lead Exposure
In addition to testing for the presence of lead in drinking water in district schools, the
following steps shall be taken to minimize potential exposure to lead in school facilities:
1. School facilities shall be kept as dust-free and clean as possible.
2. Lead-based paint, lead plumbing and solders, or other potential sources of lead
contamination shall not be used in the construction of any new school facility or the
modernization or renovation of any existing school facility. (Education Code 32244)
3. Lead exposure hazards shall be evaluated before any renovation or remodeling is
begun, and children shall not be allowed in or near buildings in which these activities
may create lead dust. Contractors and workers shall comply with state and federal
standards related to the handling and disposal of lead debris and the clean-up and
containment of dust within the construction area.
4. Lead-based painted surfaces that are in good condition shall be kept intact. If lead-
based paint is peeling, flaking, or chalking, contractors or workers shall follow state
and federal standards for safe work practices to minimize contamination when
removing the paint.
5. Soil with low lead content may be covered with grass, other plantings, concrete, or
asphalt. For soil with high lead content, removal and abatement are required.
Any action to abate existing lead hazards shall be taken only by contractors, inspectors, and
workers certified by the California Department of Public Health in accordance with 17 CCR
35001-35099. (Education Code 32243)
The Superintendent or designee shall notify parent/guardians, teachers, and staff members if
significant risk factors for lead exposure are found. (Education Code 32243)
Prevention of Mercury Exposure
The Superintendent or designee shall identify any mercury-containing products that are
present in district facilities and, to the extent possible, shall replace them with mercury-free
alternatives.
Staff shall receive information about proper procedures to follow in the event of a mercury
spill. Clean-up instructions, a clearly labeled kit with necessary clean-up supplies, and a list
of local resources shall be readily accessible.
In the event of a spill, staff shall evacuate all students from the immediate area of the spill,
ensure that any clothing or other items with mercury on them remain in the room, openwindows to the outside, and close doors to other parts of the school. Staff who are trained in
proper clean-up procedures may carefully clean a small spill. As needed for larger or
difficult-to-clean spills, the Superintendent or designee shall use an experienced professional
referred by the local health department or environmental agency.
Any products containing mercury shall be properly disposed at an appropriate hazardous
waste collection facility.
Asbestos Management
The Superintendent shall designate an employee who shall ensure that the district's
responsibilities related to asbestos inspection and abatement are implemented in accordance
with federal and state regulations. This employee shall receive adequate training to perform
these duties, including, as necessary, training on the health effects of asbestos; detection,
identification, and assessment of asbestos-containing building materials; options for
controlling asbestos-containing building materials; asbestos management programs; and
relevant federal and state regulations. (40 CFR 763.84)

Administrative Regulation
Integrated Pest Management
AR 3514.2
Business and Noninstructional Operations
Definitions
Integrated pest management (IPM) means a strategy that focuses on long-term prevention or
suppression of pest problems through a combination of techniques such as monitoring for
pest presence and establishing treatment threshold levels, using nonchemical practices to
make the habitat less conducive to pest development, improving sanitation, and employing
mechanical and physical controls. (Education Code 17609; Food and Agricultural Code
13181)
(cf. 3510 - Green School Operations)
School site means any facility used as a child day care facility or for kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary school purposes and includes the buildings or structures,
playgrounds, athletic fields, vehicles, or any other area of property visited or used by
students. (Education Code 17609)
Program Components
The Superintendent or designee shall designate an employee at the district office and/or
school site to develop, implement, and coordinate an IPM strategy that incorporates effective,
least toxic pest management practices.
The IPM coordinator shall prepare and annually update a districtwide or school site IPM plan
based on the template provided by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR).
The IPM plan shall include the name of the district and/or school IPM coordinator, the
pesticides expected to be applied at the school site by district employees and/or pest control
applicators, and a date that the plan shall be reviewed and, if necessary, updated. (Education
Code 17611.5)
The district shall use pesticides that pose the least possible hazard and are effective in a
manner that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment. Such pesticides shall
only be used after careful monitoring indicates they are needed according to pre-established
guidelines and treatment thresholds. (Food and Agricultural Code 13181)
The IPM plan and this administrative regulation shall not apply to reduced-risk pesticides,
including self-contained baits or traps, gels or pastes used for crack and crevice treatments,
antimicrobials, and pesticides exempt from registration by law. (Education Code 17610.5; 3
CCR 6147)The district's program shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following
components:
1. Identifying and monitoring pest population levels and identifying practices that could
affect pest populations. Strategies for managing the pest shall be influenced by the
pest species and whether that species poses a threat to people, property, or the
environment.
2. Setting action threshold levels to determine when pest populations or vegetation at a
specific location might cause unacceptable health or economic hazards that would
indicate corrective action should be taken.
3. Modifying or eliminating pest habitats to deter pest populations and minimize pest
infestations.
4. Considering a full range of possible alternative cost-effective treatments. Such
alternative treatments may include taking no action or controlling the pest by
physical, horticultural, or biological methods. Cost or staffing considerations alone
will not be adequate justification for the use of chemical control agents.
5. Selecting nonchemical pest management methods over chemical methods whenever
such methods are effective in providing the desired control or, when it is determined
that chemical methods must be used, giving preference to those chemicals that pose
the least hazardous effects to people and the environment.
No pesticide that is prohibited by DPR or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
as listed on the DPR web site, shall be used at a school site. (Education Code
17610.1)
6. Limiting pesticide purchases to amounts needed for the year. Pesticides shall be
stored at a secure location that is not accessible to students and unauthorized staff.
They shall be stored and disposed of in accordance with state regulations and product
label directions.
(cf. 3514 - Environmental Safety)
(cf. 3514.1 - Hazardous Substances)
7. Informing parents/guardians and employees regarding pesticide use as described in
the sections ""Notifications"" and ""Warning Signs"" below.
8. Ensuring that persons applying pesticides follow label precautions and are sufficiently
trained in the principles and practices of IPM as described in the section ""Training""
below.
9. Evaluating the effectiveness of treatments to determine if revisions to the IPM plan
are needed.Training
The IPM coordinator and any employee or contractor who may be designated to apply a
pesticide at a school site shall annually complete a DPR-approved training course on IPM
and the safe use of pesticides in relation to the unique nature of school sites and children's
health. (Education Code 17614; Food and Agricultural Code 13186.5)
(cf. 4231 - Staff Development)
Any district employee who handles pesticides shall also receive pesticide-specific safety
training prior to applying pesticides and annually thereafter in accordance with 3 CCR 6724.

Staff and parents/guardians of students enrolled at a school site shall be annually notified, in
writing, regarding pesticide products expected to be applied at the school site in the
upcoming year. The notification shall include at least the following: (Education Code 17612)
1. The name of each pesticide product expected to be applied in the upcoming year and
the active ingredient(s) in it
2. The Internet address (http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm) used to access information
on pesticides and pesticide use reduction developed by the DPR pursuant to Food and
Agricultural Code 13184
3. If the school has posted its IPM plan, the Internet address where the plan may be
found
4. The opportunity to view a copy of the IPM plan in the school office

pesticide applications at least 72 hours prior to the application. The notice shall include the
product name, the active ingredient(s) in the product, and the intended date of application.
(Education Code 17612)
If a pesticide product not included in the annual notification is subsequently intended for use
at a school site, the IPM coordinator shall provide written notification of its intended use to
staff and parents/guardians of students enrolled at the school, at least 72 hours prior to the
application. (Education Code 17612)If a school chooses to use a pesticide not exempted pursuant to Education Code 17610.5, it
shall post the school or district IPM plan on the school's web site or, if the school does not
have a web site, then on the district web site. If neither the school nor district has a web site,
then the IPM plan shall be included with the annual notification sent to staff and
parents/guardians pursuant to Education Code 17612 as described above. When not required,
the IPM coordinator may post or distribute the IPM plan at his/her discretion. (Education
Code 17611.5)
Whenever the IPM coordinator deems that the immediate use of a pesticide is necessary to
protect the health and safety of students, staff, or other persons at the school site, he/she shall
make every effort to provide the required notifications prior to the application of the
pesticide. (Education Code 17612)

3. Intended areas and dates of application
4. Reason for the pesticide application
When advance posting is not possible due to an emergency condition requiring immediate
use of a pesticide to protect the health and safety of students, staff, or other persons or the
school site, the warning sign shall be posted immediately upon application and shall remain
posted until 72 hours after the application. (Education Code 17609, 17612)
Records
At the end of each calendar year, the IPM coordinator shall submit to DPR, on a form
provided by DPR, a copy of the records of all pesticide use at the school site for that year,
excluding any pesticides exempted by law and any pesticide use reported by the pest control
operator pursuant to Food and Agricultural Code 13186. The IPM coordinator may submit
more frequent reports at his/her discretion. (Education Code 17611)
Each school site shall maintain records of all pesticide use at the school for four years, and
shall make the information available to the public, upon request, in accordance with the
California Public Records Act. A school may meet this requirement by retaining a copy of
the warning sign posted for each pesticide application with a recording on that copy of the
amount of the pesticide used. (Education Code 17611)
(cf. 1340 - Access to District Records)(cf. 3580 - District Records)

Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Drones)
BP 3515.21
Business and Noninstructional Operations
The Governing Board recognizes that unmanned aircraft or aerial systems (drones) may be a
useful tool to enhance the instructional program and assist with district operations. In order to
avoid disruption and maintain the safety, security, and privacy of students, staff, and visitors,
any person or entity desiring to use a drone on or over district property shall submit a written
request for permission to the Superintendent or designee.
(cf. 1330 - Use of School Facilities)
(cf. 1330.1 - Joint Use Agreements)
(cf. 5142 - Safety)
A small unmanned aircraft system or drone is an aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds that is
operated remotely without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the
aircraft and the associated elements, including communication links and controls, required
for the pilot to operate the aircraft safely and efficiently. It does not include model aircraft or
rockets such as those which are radio controlled and used only for hobby or recreational
purposes. (49 USC 40101 Note; 14 CFR 107.3)
The Superintendent or designee may grant permission to district employees and students for
the use of drones only if the planned activity supports instructional, co-curricular,
extracurricular, athletic, or operational purposes. Such uses may include, but are not limited
to, instruction in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), the arts, or other
subjects; maintenance of grounds and facilities; and campus security. When used for
instructional purposes, there shall be a clear and articulable connection between drone
technology and the course curriculum. Students shall only operate a drone on or over district
property under the supervision of a district employee as part of an authorized activity.
The Superintendent or designee may grant permission to other persons or entities under terms
and conditions to be specified in a memorandum of understanding.
Any person or entity requesting to operate a drone on or over district property, including a
district employee, shall provide a description of the type of operation requested, flight
location, date and time of the planned flight, anticipated duration, and whether photos and/or
video will be taken. As applicable, the applicant shall also present a copy of his/her
Certificate of Waiver or Authorization or exemption issued by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
Any person or entity, other than a district employee or student, who is requesting or
operating a drone on or over district property shall agree to hold the district harmless from
any claims of harm to individuals or property resulting from the operation of the drone and
provide proof of adequate liability insurance covering such use.(cf. 3530 - Risk Management/Insurance)
In determining whether to grant permission for the requested use of a drone, the
Superintendent or designee shall consider the intended purpose of the activity and its
potential impact on safety, security, and privacy. The decision of the Superintendent or
designee shall be final.
Any person authorized to use a drone on district property shall sign an acknowledgment that
he/she understands and will comply with the terms and conditions of the district's policy,
federal law and regulations, state law, and any local ordinances related to the use of drones.
When any use of drones is authorized, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the drone
operator of the following conditions:
1. The operator is responsible for complying with applicable federal, state, and/or local
laws and regulations, including federal safety regulations pursuant to 14 CFR 107.15-
107.51 which include, but are not limited to, requirements that the drone not be flown
at night, above 400 feet in altitude, or over any people unless they are in a covered
structure or stationary vehicle. The operator shall maintain the visual line of sight
with the drone at all times.
2. The drone shall be kept away from any area reasonably considered private, including,
but not limited to, restrooms, locker rooms, and individual homes.
3. The district reserves the right to rescind the authorization for use of drones at any
time.
The Superintendent or designee may remove any person engaged in unauthorized drone use
on district property and/or may confiscate the drone. He/she may also shut down the
operation of any authorized drone use whenever the operator fails to comply with the terms
of the authorization or the use interferes with district activity, creates electronic interference,
or poses unacceptable risks to individuals or property.
(cf. 3515.2 - Disruptions)
Any student or staff member violating this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action in
accordance with district policies and procedures.

The Superintendent or designee may work with the California Governor's Office of
Emergency Services and the Seismic Safety Commission to develop and establish the
earthquake emergency procedures. (Education Code 32282)
Earthquake emergency procedures shall outline the roles and responsibilities of students and
staff during and after an earthquake.
Earthquake emergency procedures shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(Education Code 32282)
1. A school building disaster plan, ready for implementation at any time, for maintaining
the safety and care of students and staff
2. A drop procedure whereby each student and staff member takes cover under a table or
desk, dropping to his/her knees, with the head protected by the arms and the back to
the windows
Drop procedures shall be practiced at least once each school quarter in elementary
schools and at least once each semester in secondary schools.
3. Protective measures to be taken before, during, and following an earthquake
4. A program to ensure that students and staff are aware of and properly trained in the

(cf. 4131 - Staff Development)
(cf. 4231 - Staff Development)
(cf. 4331 - Staff Development)Staff and students shall be informed of the dangers to expect in an earthquake and procedures
to be followed. Students shall be instructed to remain silent and follow directions given by
staff in such an emergency. Staff and students also shall be taught safety precautions to take
if they are in the open or on the way to or from school when an earthquake occurs.
Earthquake emergency procedures shall designate primary and alternative locations outside
of buildings, which may include areas off campus if necessary, where individuals on a school
site will assemble following evacuation. In designating such areas, the Superintendent or
designee shall consider potential post-earthquake hazards outside school buildings including,
but not limited to, power lines, trees, covered walkways, chain link fences that may be an
electric shock hazard, and areas near buildings that may have debris.
Earthquake emergency procedures also shall outline primary and alternative evacuation
routes that avoid areas with potential hazards to the extent possible. The needs of students
with disabilities shall be considered when planning evacuation routes.
The Superintendent or designee shall identify at least one individual within each building to
determine if an evacuation is necessary, the best evacuation location, and the best route to
that location when an earthquake occurs.
The Superintendent or designee shall identify potential earthquake hazards in classrooms and
other district facilities, including, but not limited to, areas where the main gas supply or
electric current enters the building, suspended ceilings, pendant light fixtures, large windows,
stairwells, science laboratories, storage areas for hazardous materials, shop areas, and
unsecured furniture and equipment. To the extent possible, dangers presented by such
potential hazards shall be minimized by securing equipment and furnishings and removing
heavy objects from high shelves.
Earthquake While Indoors at School
When an earthquake occurs, the following actions shall be taken inside buildings and
classrooms:
1. Staff shall have students perform the drop procedure. Students should stay in the drop
position until the emergency is over or until further instructions are given.
2. In laboratories, burners should be extinguished, if possible, before taking cover.
3. As soon as possible, staff shall move students away from windows, shelves, and
heavy objects or furniture that may fall.
4. After the earthquake, the principal or designee shall determine whether planned
evacuation routes and assembly locations are safe and shall communicate with
teachers and other staff.
5. When directed by the principal or designee to evacuate, or if classrooms or other
facilities present dangerous hazards that require immediate evacuation, staff shall
account for all students under their supervision and shall evacuate the building in an
orderly manner.Earthquake While Outdoors on School Grounds
When an earthquake occurs, the following actions shall be taken by staff or other persons in
authority who are outdoors on school grounds:
1. Staff shall direct students to walk away from buildings, trees, overhead power lines,
power poles, or exposed wires.
2. Staff shall have students perform the drop procedure.
3. Staff shall have students stay in the open until the earthquake is over or until further
directions are given.
Earthquake While on the Bus
If students are on the school bus when an earthquake occurs, the bus driver shall take proper
precautions to ensure student safety, which may include pulling over to the side of the road
or driving to a location away from outside hazards, if possible. Following the earthquake, the
driver shall contact the Superintendent or designee for instructions before proceeding on the
route or, if such contact is not possible, drive to an evacuation or assembly location.

Subsequent Emergency Procedures
After an earthquake episode has subsided, the following actions shall be taken:
1. Staff shall extinguish small fires if safe.
2. Staff shall provide first aid to any injured students, take roll, and report missing
students to the principal or designee.
3. Staff and students shall refrain from lighting any stoves or burners or operating any
electrical switches until the area is declared safe.
4. All buildings shall be inspected for water and gas leaks, electrical breakages, and
large cracks or earth slippage affecting buildings.
5. The principal or designee shall post staff at safe distances from all building entrances
and instruct staff and students to remain outside the buildings until they are declared
safe.
6. The principal or designee shall request assistance as needed from the county or city
civil defense office, fire and police departments, city and county building inspectors,
and utility companies and shall confer with them regarding the advisability of closing
the school.
7. The principal or designee shall contact the Superintendent or designee and request
further instructions after assessing the earthquake damage.8. The Superintendent or designee shall provide updates to parents/guardians of district
students and members of the community about the incident, any safety issues, and

Business and Noninstructional Operations
The Board of Trustees authorizes the use of consultants and other independent contractors to
provide expert professional advice or specialized technical or training services which are not
needed on a continuing basis and which cannot be provided by district staff because of
limitations of time, experience, or knowledge. Individuals, firms, or organizations employed
as independent contractors may assist management with decisions and/or project
development related to financial, economic, accounting, engineering, legal, administrative,
instructional, or other matters.
(cf. 3551 - Food Service Operations/Cafeteria Fund)
As part of the contract process, the Superintendent or designee shall determine that the
individual, firm, or organization is properly classified as an independent contractor.
A person providing labor or services for remuneration shall be considered an employee rather
than an independent contractor unless the district is able to demonstrate that all of the
following conditions have been met: (Labor Code 2775)
1. The person is free from the control and direction of the district in connection with the
performance of the work.
2. The person is performing work that is outside the usual course of the district
providing educational services.
3. The person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation,
or business of the same nature as the work to be performed.
The determination of whether an individual acting as a sole proprietor or a firm or other
business organization is an independent contractor shall be made in accordance with Labor
Code 2775-2785, as applicable.
All consultant contracts shall be brought to the Board for approval.
(cf. 3311 - Bids)
(cf. 3312 - Contracts)
(cf. 4132/4232/4332 - Publication or Creation of Materials)
All qualified independent contractors shall be accorded equal opportunity for contracts
regardless of actual or perceived race, ethnicity, color, national origin, ancestry, age,
religious creed, marital status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition,
genetic information, veteran or military status, sex, sexual orientation, gender, genderidentity, gender expression, immigration status, or association with a person or group with
one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. (Education Code 220; Government
Code 12940)
(cf. 0410 - Nondiscrimination in District Programs and Activities)
(cf. 0415 - Equity)
(cf. 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment)
Independent contractors shall submit a written conflict of interest statement disclosing
financial interests as determined necessary by the Superintendent or designee, depending on
the range of duties to be performed by the consultant. The Superintendent or designee shall
consider this statement when deciding whether to recommend approval of the contract.
Any consultant hired by the district who is subject to the filing requirements in the district's
conflict of interest code shall file a Statement of Economic Interests within the time period
required by law. (Government Code 87302)
(cf. 9270 - Conflict of Interest)
When employees of a public university, county office of education, or other public agency
serve as consultants or independent contractors in other capacities for the district, they shall
certify as part of the agreement that they will not receive salary or remuneration other than
vacation pay from any other public agency for the specific days when they work for the
district.
The Board prohibits the harassment of an independent contractor by any district employee or
by any other person with whom the independent contractor comes in contact during the
course of employment with the district. Additionally, the Board prohibits the harassment of a
district employee by an independent contractor. Any complaint of harassment shall be
investigated and resolved in accordance with applicable district complaint procedures.

educational mission and are essential to the health and well-being of the community. The Superintendent or
designee shall develop and implement a cost-effective, integrated waste management program that incorporates the
principles of green school operations.
The district's integrated waste management program shall include strategies designed to promote waste
management practices of source reduction, recycling, and composting to help the district reduce and recycle solid
and organic waste, properly dispose of potentially hazardous materials, improve efficiency in the use of natural
resources, and minimize the impact of such use on the environment. The program shall address all areas of the
district's operations, including, but not limited to, procurement, resource utilization, and facilities management
practices.
The Superintendent or designee may collaborate with city, county, and state agencies and other public or private
agencies in developing and implementing the district's integrated waste management program.
The Superintendent or designee shall make every effort to identify funding opportunities for the district's integrated
waste management program, including applying for available grants or other cost-reduction incentives.
The Superintendent or designee may provide appropriate educational and training opportunities to students and
staff regarding the benefits and methods of conserving natural resources and the manner in which integrated waste
management strategies impact such efforts.
The Superintendent or designee shall regularly monitor all aspects of the district's integrated waste management
program and shall provide an update to the Board on its effectiveness as necessary.",Strathmore_Union_Elementary_Tulare_AR3511.1.pdf,Strathmore_Union_Elementary_Tulare_AR3511.1.pdf

CSBA NOTE: The following administrative regulation may be revised to reflect district practice.
For all applicable areas of district operations, the Superintendent or designee shall design an integrated waste
management program that minimizes the generation of waste, encourages the recovery and diversion of reusable
materials from the waste stream, improves efficiency in the utilization of natural and material resources, and protects
the environment. The program shall implement measures and/or practices to:
1. Reduce the consumption of disposable materials, increase the composting of organic materials, and fully utilize
all materials prior to disposal
2. Recycle materials such as paper, glass, plastic, and aluminum
3. Prefer recycled, biodegradable, and other environmentally preferable products when procuring materials for
use in district schools and buildings or contracting for the construction or modernization of any district building
4. Work with city, county, or other government agencies to locate markets for the district's reusable and

5. Minimize the use of nonbiodegradable materials and work with vendors and contractors to use packaging and
delivery materials that generate less waste
Recycling
CSBA NOTE: Pursuant to Public Resources Code 42649.2, any business or public entity, including a school or other
district facility, which generates four or more cubic yards of commercial solid waste per week (approximately the
size of a 72-inch length, 51-inch width, and 56-inch rear height dumpster) is required to arrange for recycling
services in accordance with law, to the extent that such services are available from a local provider. Commercial
solid waste, as defined in Public Resources Code 42649.1, means any type of solid waste generated by stores,
offices, or other commercial or public entity source.
Any school site or district facility which generates four or more cubic yards of solid waste per week shall take at least
one of the following actions: (Public Resources Code 42649.1, 42649.2)
1. Source separate recyclable materials from solid waste and subscribe to a basic level of recycling service that
includes collection, self-hauling, or other arrangements for the pickup of the recyclable materials
2. Subscribe to a recycling service which may include mixed waste processing that yields diversion results
comparable to source separation
CSBA NOTE: In September 2020, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle)
determined, pursuant to Public Resources Code 42649.81, that the statewide disposal of organic waste has not
been reduced to 50 percent of the 2014 level of disposal. Thus, any school facility that generates two or more cubic
yards per week of solid waste is required to meet requirements pertaining to the recycling of organic waste as
described below. CalRecyle's Frequently Asked Questions clarify that, for this purpose, the threshold applies to
solid waste, recyclables, and organics.
CalRecycle also extended the exemption in Public Resources Code 42649.81 and 42649.83 for rural jurisdictions
that adopt a resolution as specified. Districts in rural jurisdiction that have adopted such a resolution may delete the
following paragraph.
Any school site or district facility which generates two or more cubic yards per week of solid waste, recyclables, and
organics shall arrange for recycling services specifically for organic waste, including food waste, green waste,
landscape and pruning waste, nonhazardous wood waste, and food-soiled paper waste that is mixed in with food
waste. Such facilities shall take at least one of the following actions: (Public Resources Code 42649.8, 42649.81-
42649.82, 42649.84)
1. Source separate organic waste from other waste and subscribe to a basic level of organic waste recycling
service that includes collection and recycling of organic waste2. Recycle organic waste onsite or self-haul organic waste for recycling
3. Subscribe to an organic waste recycling service that may include mixed waste processing that specifically
recycles organic waste
4. Make other arrangements to sell or donate recyclable organic waste materials
CSBA NOTE: Public Resources Code 42649.2 and 42649.81 require a school or other district facility that generates
at least four cubic yards of solid waste or two cubic yards of organic waste per week to provide recycling bins or
containers to collect material purchased on the premises. According to CalRecycle's school poster, Recycling and
Organics Recycling Guide for Schools, bins or containers must be placed where material is purchased on the
premises for immediate consumption, such as areas where food is consumed.
Any school site or district facility that meets the above thresholds for solid or organic waste shall place a recycling
bin or container for solid or organic waste, as applicable, in areas where food or other materials are purchased at the
facility for immediate consumption. The recycling bin or container shall be: (Public Resources Code 42649.2,
42649.81)
1. Adjacent to each bin or container for nonrecyclable trash, except in restrooms
2. Visible and easily accessible
CSBA NOTE: Public Resources Code 42649.2 and 42649.81 require that each recycling bin or container be
clearly marked with educational signage indicating what is appropriate to place in the bin or container.
CalRecycle provides customizable signage for this purpose on its web site, or districts may contact their local
government or waste hauler for signage.
3. Clearly marked with educational signage indicating appropriate items to be placed in the recycling bin or
container in accordance with state law and the local jurisdiction's waste ordinances and practices

Responsibilities
1. Every person is expected to be an ""energy saver"" as well as an ""energy consumer.""
2. Each staff member is responsible for implementing the guidelines during the time that he/she is present in the
classroom or office.
3. The custodian is responsible for control of common areas, i.e. halls, cafeteria, etc.
4. The custodian is responsible for verification of the nighttime shutdown, since he/she is typically the last person
to leave a building in the evening.
5. The building administrator is responsible for the total energy usage of his/her building.
6. The Energy Education Specialist performs routine audits of all facilities and communicates the audit results to
the appropriate personnel.
7. The Energy Education Specialist is responsible for either directly or indirectly making adjustments to the
district's Energy Management System (EMS), including temperature settings and run times for Heating,
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and other controlled equipment.
8. The Energy Education Specialist provides regular reports to building administrators indicating performance
with regards to energy savings.
9. The district is committed to and responsible for maintenance of the learning environment.
10. To complement the district's energy management program, the organization shall develop and implement a
preventive maintenance and monitoring plan for its facilities and systems, including HVAC, building envelope,
and moisture management.
General
1. Classroom doors shall remain closed when HVAC is operating. Doors between conditioned space and non-
conditioned space remain closed at all times (i.e. exterior hallway doors).
2. Proper and thorough utilization of data loggers will be initiated and maintained to monitor relative humidity,
temperature, and light levels throughout the district's buildings to ensure compliance with district guidelines.
3. All exhaust fans should be turned off daily.
4. All office machines (copy machines, laminating equipment, etc.) shall be switched off each night and during
unoccupied times. Fax machines should remain on.
5. All computers should be turned off each night. This includes the monitor, local printer, and speakers. Network
equipment is excluded.
6. All capable PC's should be programmed for the ""energy saver"" mode using the power management feature. If
network constraints restrict this for the PC, ensure the monitor ""sleeps"" after 20-minutes of inactivity.
Cooling Season Occupied Set Points* 74F - 78F
Unoccupied Set Point: 85F
Heating Season Occupied Set Points* 68 - 72
Unoccupied Set Point: 55F*Set points are in accordance with ASHRAE 55 ""Thermal Conditions for Human Occupancy""
Air Conditioning Equipment
1. Occupied temperature settings shall NOT be set below 74F.
2. During unoccupied times, the air conditioning equipment shall be off. The unoccupied period begins when the
students leave the area at the end of day. It is anticipated that the temperature of the classroom will be
maintained long enough to afford comfort for the period the staff remains in the classroom after the students
have left.
3. Air conditioning start times may be adjusted (depending on weather) to ensure classroom comfort when
instruction begins.
4. Ensure outside air dampers are closed during unoccupied times.
5. Ceiling fans should be operated in all areas that have them.
6. Relative humidity levels shall not exceed 60% for any 24 hour period.
7. Air conditioning should not be utilized in facilities during the summer months unless the facilities are being
used for summer school or year-round school. Offices with year-round staff are exempted from this guideline.
8. In all areas which have evaporative coolers such as shops, kitchens and gymnasiums, the doors leading to halls
which have air conditioned classrooms or dining areas should be kept closed as much as possible.
9. Where cross-ventilation is available during periods of mild weather, shut down HVAC equipment and adjust
temperature with windows and doors. Cross-ventilation is defined as having windows and/or doors to the
outside on each side of a room.
10. Ensure dry food storage areas are maintained within code requirements. Typically, this is 55¬∞F -75¬∞F
temperature and 35 percent-60 percent Relative Humidity. Utilize loggers to verify.
Heating Equipment
1. Occupied temperature settings shall NOT be above 72F.
2. The unoccupied temperature setting (i.e. setback) shall be 55F. This may be adjusted to a 60¬∞F setting during
extreme weather.
3. The unoccupied time shall begin when the students leave an area.
4. When there is no threat of freezing, all steam and forced air heating systems should be switched off during
unoccupied times. Hot water heating systems should be switched off using the appropriate loop pumps.
5. Ensure all domestic hot water systems are set no higher than 120F or 140F for cafeteria service (with
dishwasher booster).
6. Ensure all domestic hot water re-circulating pumps are switched off during unoccupied times.
7. For heat pumps, ensure a 6¬∞F dead-band between heating and cooling modes.
8. Propane levels should be physically measured and recorded by ""sticking the tanks"" at least on the following
intervals: (1) recurring scheduled monthly date (2) immediately before new delivery, (3) immediately after
delivery.
Lighting
1. All unnecessary lighting in unoccupied areas will be turned off. Staff should make certain that lights are turned
off when leaving the classroom or office when empty. Utilize natural lighting where appropriate.
2. All outside lighting shall be off during daylight hours.3. Gym lights should not be left on unless the gym is being utilized.
4. All lights will be turned off when students and staff leave for the day. Custodians will turn on lights only in the
areas in which they are working.
5. Refrain from turning lights on unless definitely needed. Remember that lights not only consume electricity, but
also give off heat that places an additional load on the air conditioning equipment and thereby increases the
use of electricity necessary to cool the room.
Water
1. Ensure all plumbing and/or intrusion (i.e. roof) leaks are reported and repaired immediately.
2. Grounds watering should only be done between 4am-10am.
3. When spray irrigating, ensure that water does not directly hit any building.
4. Consider installing water sub-meters on irrigation and cooling tower supply lines to eliminate sewer charges.",Woodland_Joint_Unified_Yolo_AR3511.1.pdf,Woodland_Joint_Unified_Yolo_AR3511.1.pdf
