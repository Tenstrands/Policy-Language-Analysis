He/she also  shall determine whether district facilities fulfill legal requirements for safety and structural  soundness, access for the disabled, and energy conservation.  In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall regularly calculate the capacity of existing  school buildings to adequately house the district's current students and projected enrollments.   Such determinations shall consider standards for use of classrooms for purposes other than  regular daily classroom instruction and minimizing the need to acquire additional classroom  space and/or require students to attend a school other than the school in their attendance area.  Any identified needs for repair, modernization, or construction shall be incorporated into the  district's facilities planning process.   Structural Safety     In the event that the Department of General Services or any licensed structural engineer or  licensed architect finds and reports to the Governing Board that a district building is unsafe for  use, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately obtain an estimate of the cost of repairs or  reconstruction necessary to bring the building up to legal standards for structural safety.  The  Board shall establish a system of priorities for the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of  unsafe school buildings (Education Code 17367).   A relocatable school building or structure shall meet the requirements of Education Code 17280- 17317 and 17365-17374 pertaining to structural safety.  However, a relocatable building that  does not meet the requirements of Education Code 17280 may be used as a school building until  September 30, 2015, if all the conditions specified in Education Code 17292 are met and the  Board so certifies to the Department of General Services (Education Code 17291, 17292).   Energy Efficiency     To the extent that services are available, the Superintendent or designee may arrange for the  energy audit of school buildings to identify the type and amount of work necessary to retrofit  buildings and obtain an estimate of projected energy savings.  The District may contract with  qualified businesses capable of retrofitting these buildings and may borrow funds which do not  exceed the amount of energy savings to be accumulated from the improvement of the buildings  (Education Code 17651-17653).

The principal of each school shall be responsible for the condition of the facility.  Teachers shall  be responsible for the condition of their classrooms.  Principals shall inspect their facilities  regularly and report conditions that may threaten the welfare of occupants.  Maintenance of Facilities     The Superintendent shall develop and supervise a program for the maintenance of school  facilities (i.e., buildings, grounds, and equipment) pursuant to standards established by the State,  which shall include but not be limited to the following:  1. a regular program of preventive maintenance  2. a regular program of facility repair and improvement  3. an equipment replacement program, when financially feasible  4. a long-range program of building modernization  5. establishment of priorities among the requests for repairs and facility improvements  Legal Reference:   EDUCATION CODE   17070.10-17077.10 Leroy F.

He/she also shall determine  whether District facilities fulfill legal requirements for safety and structural soundness, access for  the disabled, and energy conservation.    In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall regularly calculate the capacity of existing school  buildings to adequately house the District's current students and projected enrollments.    Any identified needs for repair, modernization, or construction shall be incorporated into the  District's facilities planning process.    Structural Safety    In the event that the Department of General Services or any licensed structural engineer or  licensed architect finds and reports to the Board of Trustees that a District building is unsafe for  use, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately obtain an estimate of the cost of repairs or  reconstruction necessary to bring the building up to legal standards for structural safety. The  Board shall establish a system of priorities for the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of  unsafe school buildings. (Education Code § 17367)    A relocatable school building or structure shall meet the requirements of Education Code  §§ 17280-17317 and §§ 17365-17374 pertaining to structural safety. (Education Code § 17291)    Energy Efficiency    To the extent that services are available, the Superintendent or designee shall arrange for the  energy audit of school buildings to identify the type and amount of work necessary to retrofit  buildings and obtain an estimate of projected energy savings. The District may contract with  qualified businesses capable of retrofitting these buildings and may borrow funds which do not  exceed the amount of energy savings to be accumulated from the improvement of the buildings.

In the event that the Department of General Services or any licensed structural engineer or licensed architect finds and reports to the Governing Board that a district building is unsafe for use, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately obtain an estimate of the cost of repairs or reconstruction necessary to bring the building up to legal standards for structural safety. The Board shall establish a system of priorities for the repair, reconstruction or replacement of unsafe school buildings. (Education Code 17367) Energy Efficiency When evaluating existing buildings, the Superintendent or designee shall arrange for the preaudit and postaudit of school buildings by utility companies or independent energy audit firms to the extent that these services are available. Information provided by these services shall be used to determine the cost of retrofitting the buildings and the savings which may result from adding insulation, making design modifications or using other energy-conserving devices. The district may contract with qualified businesses capable of retrofitting these buildings and may borrow funds which do not exceed the amount of energy savings to be accumulated from the improvement of the buildings. (Education Code 17651-17653) Report of Existing Building Capacity The district shall submit a one-time report of existing school capacity to the State Allocation Board. The district's, or where appropriate the attendance area's, existing school capacity shall be calculated pursuant to the formulas set forth in Education Code 17071.10-17071.40 and in 2 CCR 1859-1859.106.

Criteria for Evaluation    All facilities will ensure the safety, security, and physical comfort of students and staff  and be in accordance with the Plan.  This includes conformity to the best fire and  earthquake safety guidelines and controls as they pertain to the renovation of  telecommunication systems, lighting, heating, air conditioning, and ventilation as  necessary and appropriate at each site.    Energy Conservation    Buildings must be evaluated with energy conservation in mind.  This concern is  imperative due to increasing energy costs and diminishing supplies of energy sources.    Required Actions of the Board    In the event that the Department of General Services or any licensed structural engineer  or licensed architect finds and reports to the Governing Board that a district building is  unsafe for use, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately obtain an estimate of  the cost of repairs or reconstruction necessary to bring the building up to legal standards  for structural safety.  The Board shall establish a system of priorities for the repair,  reconstruction or replacement of unsafe school buildings.    As required by the Office of Public School Construction, “Districts are required to  establish a restricted account within the district’s general fund for the exclusive purpose  of providing funding for annual ongoing maintenance and routine repair to ensure that  State School Building Lease-Purchase projects are at all times kept in good repair and  working order.
